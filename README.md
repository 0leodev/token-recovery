This solution allows anyone to recover tokens retained in a wallet contaminated by sweeper bots. These bots, used by attackers, instantly extract all the ETH deposited in the affected wallet.

In the background, the solution employs Flashbots, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js, TypeScript, Lucide React, Dotenv, PostCSS, ESLint, Infura, Etherscan API, and Route Handlers and is currently compatible only with Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Sepolia.
